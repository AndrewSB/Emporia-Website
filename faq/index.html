<div class="faq-question">What is Robinhood?</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
  Robinhood is a stock brokerage. You can place orders using Robinhood
  to buy and sell stocks, and your self-directed orders will receive the best
  possible trade execution (across all stock exchanges).
</div>

<div class="faq-question">
  Which financial products can I buy and sell using Robinhood?
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
  You can use Robinhood to invest in publicly-traded companies and
  exchange-traded funds listed on US exchanges. This includes well
  over 5,000 securities.
</div>

<div class="faq-question">
  How does my Robinhood account work with my bank account?
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
  You can link your bank account with your Robinhood account, which allows
  you to transfer funds between your bank account and your Robinhood account.
  You can use these funds to buy and sell stocks.
</div>

<div class="faq-question">
  Is my Robinhood account protected?
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
  Robinhood is a member of the
  <a href="http://www.sipc.org">Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC)</a>,
  which protects securities customers of its members up to $500,000 (including
  $250,000 for claims for cash). Explanatory brochure available upon request
  or at <a href="http://www.sipc.org">www.sipc.org</a>.
</div>

<div class="faq-question" id="compare_brokerages">
  How is Robinhood similar to other online brokerages such as E*Trade, Schwab,
  and Scottrade?
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
  Robinhood is similar to other brokerages in that it is a registered
  broker-dealer, member <a href="http://www.finra.org">FINRA</a> &amp;
  <a href="http://www.sipc.org">SIPC</a>.
</div>

<div class="faq-question">
  How is Robinhood different from other online brokerages?
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
  Robinhood started with a simple idea: using technology, we can re-think the
  way brokerages operate. We cut out the fat that makes other brokerages costly
  &mdash; legacy technology, hundreds of storefront locations, and paper-based
  accounting. And as a result, we radically reduced costs.
  <br>
  <br>
  This means we don’t need to charge standard trade commissions or require
  minimum deposits for cash accounts. We’re committed to providing you with
  a convenient, cost efficient, and enjoyable trading experience.

    more information, please see our

<div class="faq-question">What does the name “Robinhood” mean?</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
  Robinhood is not about “taking from the rich and giving to the poor.” Instead,
  it’s about allowing everyone to fully share in the fruits of capitalism. The
  name is our way of challenging the status quo. For most of history,
  institutional investors have had advantages that were unavailable to most
  individuals. We’re changing that with Robinhood.
</div>

<div class="faq-question" id="robinhood_story">What’s the story behind Robinhood?</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
  The story of Robinhood begins almost a decade ago at Stanford University,
  where co-founders Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt were roommates &amp;
  classmates. After spending long nights toiling on problem sets together, the
  two decided to pack their bags and head to Wall Street to build a company
  that made high-frequency trading platforms for some of the world’s largest
  financial institutions.
  <br>
  <br>
  They soon learned that high frequency traders and electronic trading firms
  pay effectively nothing to place trades on the market. On the other hand,
  everyday investors were taxed up to $10 per trade. Baiju and Vladimir realized
  it was time to bring this advantage to everyone. By automating many of the
  costly duties that existing brokerages maintain as a holdover from the
  pre-Internet era, they could build a much more cost efficient and enjoyable
  brokerage. This was an opportunity and challenge they were very excited about.
</div>

<div class="faq-question">
  How is Robinhood able to offer commission-free trading while others charge
  up to $10/trade?
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
  Over the last decade, technology has enabled building the most efficient
  businesses in history. Building an automated, electronic brokerage from the
  ground up allows Robinhood to eliminate the costly touchpoints where other
  brokerages require human intervention or paper receipts. Rather than relying
  on primetime advertisements and costly brick-and-mortar storefronts,
  Robinhood maintains a lean bottom-line, allowing it to attract and retain
  customers far more cheaply.
</div>

<div class="faq-question" id="how_we_make_money">
  How does Robinhood make money?
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
  Robinhood will offer margin trading as well as API access, which will allow 
  partnered developers to build applications in conjunction with Robinhood.
  Robinhood will also receive remuneration for providing trade volume in
  certain markets. In the future, we plan to offer premium services for active
  investors.
  <br>
  <br>
  Robinhood is venture-funded by Google, Andreessen Horowitz and many others,
  which affords us the freedom to focus on building a wonderful brokerage
  experience rather than short-term profits.
</div>

<div class="faq-question">How much money do I need to start trading?</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
  Robinhood does not have a minimum account balance for cash accounts.
</div>

        </div>
        <div class="faq-section" data-section="invite">
          <div class="faq-question">How does the Robinhood invitation system work?</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
  You can request an invitation by entering your email address at the top of
  the screen. We’ll send you an invitation via email when it’s your turn to
  apply for an account. This depends on the queue’s length as well as Robinhood’s
  registration status in your home state.
</div>

<div class="faq-question">Why does Robinhood use an invitation system?</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
  An invitation system allows us to control the rate at which new users join,
  and in turn, the load on our infrastructure. We have an obligation to our
  customers and public markets to offer a robust, error-free service. We take
  this obligation very seriously. 
  <br>
  <br>
  We are working as hard as we can to get Robinhood into everyone’s hands
  quickly.
</div>

<div class="faq-question">
  I requested an invite by entering my email. How long before I can start
  trading?
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
  We can’t say specifically how long it will take for you to get an invitation,
  but you can track your position using the website or the mobile app. We’ll
  let new customers in slowly at first, but in time we will dramatically
  increase the pace. The goal is to reach a point where the reservation system
  becomes unnecessary.
</div>

<div class="faq-question">
  Can I improve my position in the waiting list, and if so, how?
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
  If you’re really excited, you can improve your position in line by referring
  friends with valid email addresses to Robinhood. Line position is determined
  by referral count, with ties broken by signup date.
</div>

        </div>
        <div class="faq-section" data-section="signup">
          

<div class="faq-question">
  Why does Robinhood ask for my employment information when I open an account?
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
  Robinhood is required to ask every new customer if they are employed
  by or affiliated with another securities firm, or in an executive position at
  a publically traded company. This check exists to protect the U.S. markets
  and economy from manipulation (e.g. insider trading).
  <br>
  <br>
  As with all of your personal information, this data is transmitted securely
  using SSL encryption.
</div>

<div class="faq-question">
  When I open an account, why does Robinhood ask for my social security number,
  birth date, and mailing address?
</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
  Robinhood is required to perform anti-money-laundering checks on new
  accounts. These checks exist to protect the U.S. markets and economy from
  known money launderers or individuals associated with terrorist activities.

</div>

<div class="faq-question">Does Robinhood support options trading?</div>
<div class="faq-answer">
  Not yet, but we plan to offer options trading in the near future and expand
  to other asset classes shortly thereafter.

This is not an offer, solicitation of an offer, or advice to buy or sell
securities, or open a brokerage account in any jurisdiction where Robinhood is
not registered. Getting &quot;early access&quot; to Robinhood is defined as
signing up with a valid email address for a spot in Robinhood's waitlist queue.

up with a valid email address. There is no limitation on the number of
referrals you can make and the number of positions you can move in line.
Residents of jurisdictions where Robinhood is registered will be notified
first, based on their current position in line and will be given an invitation
to access Robinhood's brokerage account opening application process. Early
access to Robinhood's waitlist queue should in no way be construed as
confirmation that a brokerage account has been opened or will even be approved
for opening.

        System response, execution price, speed, liquidity, market data, and account
access times are affected by many factors, including market volatility, size
and type of order, market conditions, system performance, and other factors.
