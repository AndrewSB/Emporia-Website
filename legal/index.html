Robinhood is currently registered in the following
<a
  href="https://brokerage-static.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHF%20Jurisdictions.pdf"
  target="_blank">jurisdiction(s)</a>.
This is not an offer, solicitation of an offer, or advice to buy or sell
securities, or open a brokerage account in any jurisdiction where Robinhood is
not registered. Getting &quot;early access&quot; to Robinhood is defined as
signing up with a valid email address for a spot in Robinhood's waitlist queue.
You can improve your spot in the queue each time you refer someone who signs
up with a valid email address. There is no limitation on the number of
referrals you can make and the number of positions you can move in line.
Residents of jurisdictions where Robinhood is registered will be notified
first, based on their current position in line and will be given an invitation
to access Robinhood's brokerage account opening application process. Early
access to Robinhood's waitlist queue should in no way be construed as
confirmation that a brokerage account has been opened or will even be approved
for opening.
<br><br>
        System response, execution price, speed, liquidity, market data, and account
access times are affected by many factors, including market volatility, size
and type of order, market conditions, system performance, and other factors.
<br><br>
        All investments involve risk and the past performance of a security, or
financial product does not guarantee future results or returns. There is always
the potential of losing money when you invest in securities, or other financial
products. Investors should consider their investment objectives and risks
carefully before investing.
